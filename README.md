## spring-boot-JPA-and-Postgre-Sql-Crud-and-joins


This is a sample project in springboot and jpa(hibernate) using postgre sql database. 

**Postgre sql** is a ORDBMS or Object Relational Database Management System, it also supports large subset of MYSQL. 
> Postgre sql queries are also similar to mysql, but very few changes in datatype such as float to real.
 
`Note: This is a postgre sql database implementation of the project i've already developed`
